### [How software engineering will evolve in 2024](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335664/how-software-engineering-will-evolve-in-2024.html)
I thought this article was extremely insightful and interesting because it explored many of the new technologies that we often overlook when discussing the future of technology. For many, AI is the first thing that when asked "What is the future of technology?" While AI technology is certainly exciting and will play a pivotal role in shaping our future, technologies such as digitial twins, platform engineering and chaos engineering also deserve recognition as technologies that can help simplify and advance the field of software engineering. In addition, the development of AI can also work to compliment and further enable these emerging technologies One example of how AI can help further enable these technologies is its ability to help digital twins dynamically model and adjust complex systems in real time and making their deployments more efficient and. Overall, reading through this article made me exicted to see how these emerging technologies develop in the years to come and how soon they can be integrated into our daily lives to help simplify any repetitive tasks that we may have to do.
